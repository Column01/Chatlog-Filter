## Decypher 

Decypher can crack passwords for encrypted files as well in an EXTREMELY efficient way! Give it a go with the `encoded_output.txt` file to test it. **This May spoil parts of the game! Use at your own discretion**

You can also encode custom files to leave a calling card or easter egg. Currently it does not support password input but I can make it available if people want it (defeats the purpose since you can crack them so easily). 

The encrypted file has a valid header format so you can see the name and source of the file with the DecHead program in game! The algorithm is fairly simple but it was really fun to learn how the encryption works and reverse engineering it for this script.
