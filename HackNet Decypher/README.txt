Decypher can crack file's passwords as well EXTREMELY efficiently! Give it a go with the encoded_output.txt file to test it!
You can also encode custom files to leave a calling card (with a valid DecHead format so you can see the name and source of the file with the internal exe in the game)

The algorithm is fairly simple but it was really fun to learn how the encryption works and reverse engineering it!
