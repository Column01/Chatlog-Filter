### Disclaimer

Some games will **ban** you for using Anti AFK scripts like this, although the random delays do help prevent you from being detected as using a macro. 

Please be aware that I am not responsible if you do get banned while using this in **ANY** game. 

Also, this might not work for all games as some have advanced techniques to detect AFK players.
