# Array Index Marker

Takes an input array from a file and indexes it to a file. This is useful if you need a specific index from an array and are having trouble finding it by counting them.

## Usage

**Note:** You can use the `test.txt` file to test it

1. Place your array that looks like: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` into a `txt` file
2. Run with `python array_indexer.py`
3. Enter the name of your input file and it will index it
